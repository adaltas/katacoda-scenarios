## Step 2 - Run and manage containers

1. Run the Redis database container using `docker run -d redis`

  What does the `-d` option? Try to run the same container without this option (press `Ctrl + C` to terminate the blocking process).

2. Find the following commands and explore the Docker host by reading and understanding the output:
  
  - list Docker images
  - list only running containers
  - list all containers

3. Manage containers:
  
  - Stop a running container
  - Start a stopped container
  - Restart a container
  - Kill a container (learn the difference from "stop" container)
  - Remove a stopped/killed container
  - Remove a running container (using the "force" mode)

4. Fetch the logs of a container
